# NYSE-prediction-prices
Deep Learning project

## Project overview:

We use two datasets relative to historical data for stocks market at the New York Stock Exchange market for the year 2016. We performed an exploratory data analysis of those stocks and created a neural net mix of GRU with LSTM models to predict prices. The predictions and the real values follow the same trends of growth or ungrowth genreally speaking and around certain periods of time (before the 50th day of that year and around day 130) they almost coalesce. 

## Code and resources used:
**Python version:** 3.7
**Packages:libraries:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikitlearn, math, keras.
**Datasets:** available at Kaggle
